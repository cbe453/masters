Ian
 DONE - thesis needs a statement that explicitly states whether and how generative AI was used
 DONE - have a list of research objectives earlier.  Use point form.
 - remove research questions that weren't actually answered.  Reword the research question
   where it was just partially answered
 DONE - in Section 2.6 site any comparison studies of gene finders
 - 4th last line on page 16, answer the question "increase relative to what?"
 - regarding Figure 4.3, what would one expect?  Perhaps give a figure.
 - reword the sentence "We refer to a gene as a set of start and stop coordinates 
   in a genomic sequence" on page 32
 - if you can add more details about the tools underlying the RefSeq pipeline that
   are relevant to the thesis, please do so
 - replace the summary table in your thesis with the one in your presentation

Lingling
 - have a list of research questions earlier
 - in the Abstract make it clearer how you decided which was best
 - make it clearer what you mean by "ease of use" in the Results section.
 - used the term "biological validation".  However there is little actual biological validation.
   Adjust wording.
 - add a little of discussion about hits (genes) which are not in InterProScan.  They might be
   false positives or they might be novel genes.
 - add some links in the thesis document to materials on github

Dave
 - use the word bimodal to describe the distribution of GC content
 - all the tools in the RefSeq pipeline should be available.  Unknown is how they are put
   together and parameters used.
