  \frametitle{Background: \textit{Trichoderma}}
  What is \textit{Trichoderma}?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Trichoderma} is an opportunistic symbiotic fungi, which
    can colonize the roots of plants
  \item \textit{Trichoderma} strains have been shown to provide
    several benefits to the host plant it colonizes, those generally
    being:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Increased resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors
      \item Facilitating nutrient uptake
      \item Increased germination rates
    \end{itemize}
  \item Because of \textit{Trichoderma's} potential to produce
    materials which aid in resistance to bacteria and other fungi in
    soil, several \textit{Trichoderma} strains have been well studied
    and are employed in the use of manufacturing antibiotics and other
    materials
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Background: Previous GIFS Work}
  Two strains have been sequenced in previous work within GIFS:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DC1 and Tsth20
  \item Strains from the prairie regions of Canada, including Alberta
    and Saskatchewan
  \item One strain has been shown to provide resistance for plants
    growing in soils with high salt content, the other has potential
    for use as a bioremediation agent in soils contaminated with
    hydrocarbons
  \item How exactly do these processes work? Which genes are included
    in these processes?
  \item To lay groundwork for better understanding, we must identify
    potential genes in these strains
  \item To answer these questions, both strains were sequenced with
    Illumina and Nanopore technologies
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Research Problem} These sequenced strains offer an
  opportunity to assemble and annotate them:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Genome assembly is 'relatively' straight-forward
  \item However, the choice of a tool for gene finding or annotation
    is uncertain
  \item There has been relatively little comparative analysis for gene
    finding tools in fungi, and even fewer for \textit{Trichoderma}
  \item This raises questions. How do different gene finding tools
    perform in fungi and \textit{Trichoderma} in particular?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Project Goal} This project aims to evaluate several
  different gene finding tools in the context of \textit{Trichoderma}
  genomes
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Gene finding tools currently selected are GeneMark-ES,
      GenomeThreader, and Braker2
    \item These tools include a mix of \textit{ab initio},
      evidence-based and hybrid gene finding methods
    \item This list is not final and may include more tools if
      desired or necessary
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Evaluation of Gene Finding Tools} A methodology for
  evaluating and comparing the selected tools needs to be
  developed. Metrics for comparison will include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Gene finding features
  \item Efficiency of selected gene finding tools (i.e. runtimes,
    memory requirements)
  \item Requirements of selected gene finding tools and ease of
    installation
  \item Comparison ('validation') of called genes with existing RNASeq data if
    available
  \item Identification of small RNAs and genes in repetitive and
    AT-rich regions
  \item Distribution of lengths of called genes (particularly in the
    case of \textit{ab initio} gene finders)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Current Progress}
  Preliminary assemblies for both DC1 and Tsth20 are ready
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Two assemblies for each strain using both SPAdes and MaSuRCA
  \item Both assemblers use a hybrid assembly approach
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
