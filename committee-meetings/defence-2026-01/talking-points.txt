Defence talking points:

slide 3:
- breaking down biological matter and other pathogens
- promote plant growth
- secondary metabolites are a key component of these phenotypes

slide 4:
- many novel species remain unstudied although potentially useful
- improve growth in sandy soils near oils sands
- illumina and nanopore data

slide 5:
- different gene prediction methods like de novo and others that include training data
- what makes Trichoderma tick? 

slide 6:
- genes can be sliced and put together in many combinations


slide 7:
- in particular stop positions
- where will products end up if each gene prediction is correct but different?

slide 11: 
- using hybrid assembly
- including virens, harzianum and reesei

slide 13:
- assembling the nanopore sequences and polishing with illumine using nextDenovo and nextPolish
- apply gene finders to all assemblies
- evaluate gene predictions with interproscan, busco, blast and whatnot
- identify regions for further processing

slide 16:
- much fewer contigs, similar lengths, larger contigs etc.
- garbage in garbage out 

slide 17:
- if one were to randomly sample gene lengths from all predictions, we see that they are not being pulled from the same underlying distribution of gene lengths

slide 18:
- in general for DC1 and Tsth20, predictions agree
- when three tools are included, most regions contain disagreement

slide 19:
- these regions contain less than 28% GC content
- t virens is an odd case

slide 20:
- these clusters are large and can be spread over 100kb
- polyketide synthetases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, terpenes

slide 21:
- useful to rank gene finders overall. these are not scores
- important to note that refseq is included for reference and is not a tool available for use
- if your genome were to be a refseq, you could expect similar results
- overall braker2 ranked the highest, with appropriate training data
- GeneMark ranked lowest, but still useful
