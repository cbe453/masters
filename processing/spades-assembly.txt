Initial file for description of methods used for SPAdes

2022-11-29

SPAdes version () was used for hybrid assemblies of Tsth30 and DC1. This assembler
was installed using Anaconda and the bioinformatcs environment managed by myself and
others in the p2irc_rsmi storage space in scratch on Copernicus. The assembly process
straightforward, following the standard protocol from their manual for a hybrid
assembly of Nanopore and Illumina read data.

To run SPAdes, use the following command structure:

spades --pe1-1 input-R1.fastq --pe1-2 input-R2.fastq --nanopore input-nanopore.fastq -t 48 -o assembly.fasta
