Evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbour-Joining method~\cite {Saitou1987}. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.146 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches~\cite {Felsenstein1985}. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree.}}{3}{figure.caption.13}%
