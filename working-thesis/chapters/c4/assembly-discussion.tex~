\section{Assemblies of DC1 and Tsth20}
Overall, the assemblies of DC1 and Tsth20 resulted in what can be
described as sequences suitable for further downstream
processing. Assembled lengths for both samples are similar to closely
related \textit{Trichoderma} accessions, indicating that the
assemblies are of appropriate length, but this could be confirmed with
further wetlab experiments in the future. The assembly of DC1 resulted
in 8 contigs, with two sequences, ctg000000 and ctg000050 being
significantly shorter than their counterparts, which deviates from the
expected 7 chromosome-scale contigs expected from a
\textit{Trichoderma} assembly\cite{Kubicek2019}. Why these sequences
are significantly shorter than other contigs is unclear, but could
arise for several reasons. The most obvious reason would be a
mis-assembly, which could arise from complications caused by both the
anomolous GC content reginos as well as highly repetitive
regions. Even with the inclusion of Nanopore sequencing data, it is
possible that there was insufficient support for connection between
these contigs and others. This highlights the complexity of assembling
sequences with anomolous content and supports the idea that multiple
rounds and forms of sequencing data may be required to produce
scaffold and reference level assemblies of non-model organisms.
