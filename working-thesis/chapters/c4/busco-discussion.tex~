\section{BUSCO Analysis}

The results from BUSCO analysis of the gene sets produced by each
prediction method prove promising. With all gene sets being 99.2\%
complete or higher based on the fungal dataset provided to BUSCO. This
higher number indicates that these gene finding tools capture nearly
completely the set of evolutionarily conserved single-copy orthologs
pre-defined by BUSCO curators. In the case of the fungal dataset,
there are 758 genes considered during analysis.

The most glaring observation from this analysis is the duplication
level found in the gene sets produced by Braker in comparison to the
GeneMark and RefSeq datasets. The Braker gene sets show a single-copy
match for roughly 80-85\% of the total gene call set with duplicates
making up the other 15-20\% of the set.
