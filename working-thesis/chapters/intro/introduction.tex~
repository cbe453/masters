The study of organisms in Biology is a highly complex complex process
involving many disciplines. To better understand how these organisms
function, we must braker down the problem into different
sub-problems. One important sub-problem in biology is the
understanding of the molecular tools and processes used by cells to
function in normal and abnormal environmental scenarios or stress
conditions. These conditions may include disease and environmental
stress for example. However, previous work in biology has shown that
the underlying backbone of information, known as the genome, can vary
widely between different organisms in many aspects, such as length,
ploidy, methylation, and overall gene content
