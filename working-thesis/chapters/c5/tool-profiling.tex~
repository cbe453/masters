\section{Profiling Gene Finding Tools}

While Braker2, GeneMark and RefSeq all provide lists of possible genes
for a provided reference, the implementation for each tool is
different, requiring more, less or completely different kinds of work
depending on the tool used.

First, we will discuss installation of both Braker2 and
GeneMark. Braker2 is hosted on GitHub as a repository that recieves
relatively frequent updates with Braker3 being released during the
time elapsed while working on this thesis.
