\section{Initial Gene Finding Results} 

Counts of genes predicted by Braker2, GeneMark and RefSeq are shown in
table \ref{table:gene-counts}. Immediately we see that Braker2
predicts far fewer genes in all assemblies, except in the case of
\textit{Trichoderma reesei.} This is possibly due to the effects of
training the Braker2 gene model using data from \textit{Trichoderma
  reesei.} Given the shorter length of the \textit{T. reesei}
assembly, and subsequently fewer genes present, the trained model may
predict fewer genes in other assemblies. Regardless, there is a
significant difference in the number of genes predicted by Braker2 in
comparison to GeneMark and RefSeq. The number of genes predicted by
GeneMark and RefSeq are similar, except in the case of
\textit{T. harzianum}, in which RefSeq predicts roughly 17\% more
genes than GeneMark. Braker2 consistently predicts more transcripts
than GeneMark and RefSeq. RefSeq also appears to predict isoforms but
in fewer numbers than Braker2. Transcript prediction counts in
\textit{T. harzianum} from RefSeq are also interesting, with RefSeq
predicting fewer transcripts than genes. Why this is occurs is unknown
but may warrant further investigation.
