abstract = {Single-molecule, real-time sequencing developed by Pacific BioSciences offers longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

abstract = {Structural features of genomes, including the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in the nucleus, are increasingly seen as key contributors to the regulation of gene expression. However, studies on how genome structure and nuclear organisation influence transcription have so far been limited to a handful of model species. This narrow focus limits our ability to draw general conclusions about the ways in which three-dimensional structures are encoded, and to integrate information from three-dimensional data to address a broader gamut of biological questions. Here, we generate a complete and gapless genome sequence for the filamentous fungus, Epichlo{\"{e}} festucae. We use Hi-C data to examine the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and RNA-seq data to investigate how Epichlo{\"{e}} genome structure contributes to the suite of transcriptional changes needed to maintain symbiotic relationships with the grass host. Our results reveal a genome in which very repeat-rich blocks of DNA with discrete boundaries are interspersed by gene-rich sequences that are almost repeat-free. In contrast to other species reported to date, the three-dimensional structure of the genome is anchored by these repeat blocks, which act to isolate transcription in neighbouring gene-rich regions. Genes that are differentially expressed in planta are enriched near the boundaries of these repeat-rich blocks, suggesting that their three-dimensional orientation partly encodes and regulates the symbiotic relationship formed by this organism.},

abstract = {Early efforts at sequencing the genomes of bacteria, viruses, and yeast allowed scientists to test and troubleshoot methods of automated sequencing, chromosome assembly, and gene annotation. Using these methods, researchers were able to sequence several unicellular genomes by the year 2000. However, many interesting biological questions remained, and a great deal of these questions related to issues involving development, disease, and complex traits that are found only in multicellular organisms. For example, how are limbs and tissues encoded in the genome? How is the brain made? What are the genetic contributions to behavior? Today, researchers are deeply involved in the shotgun sequencing of various complex genomes in an attempt to answer such questions. Interestingly, they have found that neither genome size nor number of genes determines the complexity of multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {Members of the genus Trichoderma (Hypocreales), widely used as biofungicides,  biofertilizers, and as model fungi for the industrial production of CAZymes, have actively been studied for the applications of their biological functions. Recently, the study of the nuclear genomes of Trichoderma has expanded in the directions of adaptation and evolution to gain a better understanding of their ecological traits. However, Trichoderma's mitochondria have received much less attention despite mitochondria being the most necessary element for sustaining cell life. In this study, a mitogenome of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum CBS 226.95 was assembled de novo. A 27,632 bp circular DNA molecule was revealed with specific features, such as the intronless of all core PCGs, one homing endonuclease, and a putative overlapping tRNA, on a closer phylogenetic relationship with T. reesei among hypocrealean fungi. Interestingly, the mitogenome of T. harzianum CBS 226.95 was predicted to have evolved earlier than those of other Trichoderma species and also assumed with a selection pressure in the cox3. Considering the bioavailability, both for the ex-neotype strain of the T. harzianum species complex and the most globally representative commercial fungal biocontrol agent, our results on the T. harzianum CBS 226.95 mitogenome provide crucial information which will be helpful criteria in future studies on Trichoderma.},

abstract = {The task of eukaryotic genome annotation remains challenging. Only a few genomes  could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all alternative isoforms, even in the best-annotated genomes, could be a good subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.},

A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website. AVAILABILITY: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast .

The intricacy of this plant–microorganism association has stimulated a marked interest in research on Trichoderma, ranging from its capacity as a plant growth promoter to its ability to prime local and systemic defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses and to activate transcriptional memory affecting plant responses to future stresses. This Review discusses the ecophysiology and diversity of Trichoderma and the complexity of its relationships in the agroecosystem, highlighting its potential as a direct and indirect biological control agent, biostimulant and biofertilizer, which are useful multipurpose properties for agricultural applications.

faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division.
It has become evident that centromeres can be established
literally on any DNA sequence, and the possible synergy between
DNA sequences and the most prominent centromere identifiers,
protein components, and epigenetic marks remains uncertain.
However, some evolutionary preferences seem to exist, and
long-term established centromeres are frequently formed on long
arrays of satellite DNAs and/or transposable elements. Recent
progress in understanding functional centromere sequences is
based largely on the high-resolution DNA mapping of sequences
that interact with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant,
the most reliable marker of active centromeres. In addition,
sequence assembly and mapping of large repetitive centromeric
regions, as well as comparative genome analyses offer insight
into their complex organization and evolution. The rapidly
advancing field of transcription in centromere regions
highlights the functional importance of centromeric transcripts.

By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future.

Recent tools have sought to address this need by focusing on assembly tasks in which exact algorithms are feasible.The availability of multiple sequencing technologies and library preparation protocols has brought into focus the importance of experimental design in sequence assembly.Coupling of experimental design with the development of assembly algorithms may be key to optimizing assembly results in the future.A combination of in silico assessment and validation using independent experimental data is currently used to assess the reliability of sequence assembly, although computational tools for assembly validation are still limited in number.Sequence assembly is increasingly used for applications other than the traditional role of assembling genomes, including transcriptome analysis, reconstruction of microbial communities (metagenomics) and the discovery of genomic variants.Application-specific assemblers, which exploit characteristics of the sequences to be reconstructed, have emerged as an important area of focus for assembly research.},

abstract = {Abstract Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from OrthoDB, BUSCO can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the BUSCO tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various BUSCO running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the BUSCO setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and BUSCO “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using BUSCO results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.
