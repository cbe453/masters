abstract = {Early efforts at sequencing the genomes of bacteria, viruses, and yeast allowed scientists to test and troubleshoot methods of automated sequencing, chromosome assembly, and gene annotation. Using these methods, researchers were able to sequence several unicellular genomes by the year 2000. However, many interesting biological questions remained, and a great deal of these questions related to issues involving development, disease, and complex traits that are found only in multicellular organisms. For example, how are limbs and tissues encoded in the genome? How is the brain made? What are the genetic contributions to behavior? Today, researchers are deeply involved in the shotgun sequencing of various complex genomes in an attempt to answer such questions. Interestingly, they have found that neither genome size nor number of genes determines the complexity of multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {The task of eukaryotic genome annotation remains challenging. Only a few genomes  could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all alternative isoforms, even in the best-annotated genomes, could be a good subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.},

abstract = {There are two major paradigms in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology: short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing. Short-read sequencing approaches provide lower-cost, higher-accuracy data that are useful for population-level research and clinical variant discovery. By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future. Many new instruments with varied chemistries and applications are being released or being developed.},

abstract = {Motivation: As improved DNA sequencing techniques have increased enormously the speed of producing new eukaryotic genome assemblies, the further development of automated gene prediction methods continues to be essential.While the classification of proteins into families is a task heavily relying on correct gene predictions, it can at the same time provide a source of additional information for the prediction, complementary to those presently used.Results: We extended the gene prediction software AUGUSTUS by a method that employs block profiles generated from multiple sequence alignments as a protein signature to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Equipped with profiles modelling human dynein heavy chain (DHC) proteins and other families, AUGUSTUS was run on the genomic sequences known to contain members of these families. Compared with AUGUSTUS' ab initio version, the rate of genes predicted with high accuracy showed a dramatic increase.Availability: The AUGUSTUS project web page is located at http://augustus.gobics.de, with the executable program as well as the source code available for download.Contact: keller@cs.uni-goettingen.de; mario.stanke@uni-greifswald.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies and increased access to sequencing have led to recent renewed interest in sequence assembly algorithms and tools.Assembly continues to be a computationally challenging problem in which engineering 'details' play a more important part than the choice of a specific assembly paradigm in defining the performance and accuracy of assemblers.Modern sequence assemblers continue to explore new ways to capture and to analyse graph structures to carry out assembly in a time- and memory-efficient manner.Most assembly programs are based on heuristics and ad hoc techniques and provide no guarantees on the correctness of the reconstructed sequence. Recent tools have sought to address this need by focusing on assembly tasks in which exact algorithms are feasible.The availability of multiple sequencing technologies and library preparation protocols has brought into focus the importance of experimental design in sequence assembly.Coupling of experimental design with the development of assembly algorithms may be key to optimizing assembly results in the future.A combination of in silico assessment and validation using independent experimental data is currently used to assess the reliability of sequence assembly, although computational tools for assembly validation are still limited in number.Sequence assembly is increasingly used for applications other than the traditional role of assembling genomes, including transcriptome analysis, reconstruction of microbial communities (metagenomics) and the discovery of genomic variants.Application-specific assemblers, which exploit characteristics of the sequences to be reconstructed, have emerged as an important area of focus for assembly research.},

Repeats have always presented technical challenges for sequence alignment and assembly programs.

From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

abstract = {Structural features of genomes, including the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in the nucleus, are increasingly seen as key contributors to the regulation of gene expression. However, studies on how genome structure and nuclear organisation influence transcription have so far been limited to a handful of model species. This narrow focus limits our ability to draw general conclusions about the ways in which three-dimensional structures are encoded, and to integrate information from three-dimensional data to address a broader gamut of biological questions. Here, we generate a complete and gapless genome sequence for the filamentous fungus, Epichlo{\"{e}} festucae. We use Hi-C data to examine the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and RNA-seq data to investigate how Epichlo{\"{e}} genome structure contributes to the suite of transcriptional changes needed to maintain symbiotic relationships with the grass host. Our results reveal a genome in which very repeat-rich blocks of DNA with discrete boundaries are interspersed by gene-rich sequences that are almost repeat-free. In contrast to other species reported to date, the three-dimensional structure of the genome is anchored by these repeat blocks, which act to isolate transcription in neighbouring gene-rich regions. Genes that are differentially expressed in planta are enriched near the boundaries of these repeat-rich blocks, suggesting that their three-dimensional orientation partly encodes and regulates the symbiotic relationship formed by this organism.},

Trichoderma utilizes direct antagonism and competition, particularly in the rhizosphere, where it modulates the composition of and interactions with other microorganisms.

The intricacy of this plant–microorganism association has stimulated a marked interest in research on Trichoderma, ranging from its capacity as a plant growth promoter to its ability to prime local and systemic defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses and to activate transcriptional memory affecting plant responses to future stresses. This Review discusses the ecophysiology and diversity of Trichoderma and the complexity of its relationships in the agroecosystem, highlighting its potential as a direct and indirect biological control agent, biostimulant and biofertilizer, which are useful multipurpose properties for agricultural applications.
