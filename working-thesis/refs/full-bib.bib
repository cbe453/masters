In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from {RNA}-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including {RSEM} for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can be processed in less than 5 h.},

It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies.

Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, {RNA}-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 × 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makes de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge.Results: Here, we present {SOAPdenovo}-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for {RNA}-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how {SOAPdenovo}-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that {SOAPdenovo}-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.Availability and implementation: Source code and user manual are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovotrans/.Contact:xieyl@genomics.cn or bgi-soap@googlegroups.{comSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Bacteria of the Paenibacillus genus are becoming important in many fields of science, including agriculture, for their positive effects on the health of plants. However, there are little information available on this genus compared to other bacteria (such as Bacillus or Pseudomonas), especially when considering genomic information. Sequencing the genomes of plant-beneficial bacteria is a crucial step to identify the genetic elements underlying the adaptation to life inside a plant host and, in particular, which of these features determine the differences between a helpful microorganism and a pathogenic one. In this study, we have characterized the genome of Paenibacillus pasadenensis, strain R16, recently investigated for its antifungal activities and plant-associated features. An hybrid assembly approach was used integrating the very precise reads obtained by Illumina technology and long fragments acquired with Oxford Nanopore Technology ({ONT}) sequencing. De novo genome assembly based solely on Illumina reads generated a relatively fragmented assembly of 5.72 Mbp in 99 ungapped sequences with an N50 length of 544 Kbp; hybrid assembly, integrating Illumina and {ONT} reads, improved the assembly quality, generating a genome of 5.75 Mbp, organized in 6 contigs with an N50 length of 3.4 Mbp. Annotation of the latter genome identified 4987 coding sequences, of which 1610 are hypothetical proteins. Enrichment analysis identified pathways of particular interest for the endophyte biology, including the chitin-utilization pathway and the incomplete siderophore pathway which hints at siderophore parasitism. In addition the analysis led to the identification of genes for the production of terpenes, as for example farnesol, that was hypothesized as the main antifungal molecule produced by the strain. The functional analysis on the genome confirmed several plant-associated, plant-growth promotion, and biocontrol traits of strain R16, thus adding insights in the genetic bases of these complex features, and of the Paenibacillus genus in general.},

Many successful assembly applications of the Pacific Biosciences technology have been reported ranging from small bacterial genomes to large plant and animal genomes. Recently, genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore {MinION} data have attracted much attention due to the portability and low cost of this novel sequencing instrument. In this paper, we re-sequenced a well characterized genome, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain using three different platforms: {MinION}, {PacBio} and {MiSeq}.

As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S {rRNA} gene using Illumina's {MiSeq} platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S {rRNA} gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S {rRNA} gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

The genus Lens consists of seven taxa, however, there are many discrepancies in the taxon and gene pool classification of lentil and its wild relatives. Due to the narrow genetic basis of cultivated lentil, there is a need towards better understanding of the relationships amongst wild germplasm to assist introgression of favourable genes into lentil breeding programs. Genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) is an easy and affordable method that allows multiplexing of up to 384 samples or more per library to generate genome-wide single nucleotide Polymorphism ({SNP}) markers. In this study, we aimed to characterize our lentil germplasm collection using a two-enzyme {GBS} approach. We constructed two 96-plex {GBS} libraries with a total of 60 accessions where some accessions had several samples and each sample was sequenced in two technical replicates. We developed an automated {GBS} pipeline and detected a total of 266,356 genome-wide {SNPs}. After filtering low quality and redundant {SNPs} based on haplotype information, we constructed a maximum-likelihood tree using 5,389 {SNPs}. The phylogenetic tree grouped the germplasm collection into their respective taxa with strong support. Based on phylogenetic tree and {STRUCTURE} analysis, we identified four gene pools, namely L. culinaris/L. orientalis/L. tomentosus, L. lamottei/L. odemensis, L. ervoides and L. nigricans which form primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary gene pools, respectively. We discovered sequencing bias problems likely due to {DNA} quality and observed severe run-to-run variation in the wild lentils. We examined the authenticity of the germplasm collection and identified 17\% misclassified samples.

In the present study, the transcriptome of chickpea was sequenced with short reads on Illumina Genome Analyzer platform. We have assessed the effect of sequence quality, various assembly parameters and assembly programs on the final assembly output. We assembled ∼107million high-quality trimmed reads using Velvet followed by Oases with optimal parameters into a non-redundant set of 53 409 transcripts (≥100 bp), representing about 28 Mb of unique transcriptome sequence. The average length of transcripts was 523 bp and N50 length of 900 bp with coverage of 25.7 rpkm (reads per kilobase per million). At the protein level, a total of 45 636 (85.5\%) chickpea transcripts showed significant similarity with unigenes/predicted proteins from other legumes or sequenced plant genomes. Functional categorization revealed the conservation of genes involved in various biological processes in chickpea. In addition, we identified simple sequence repeat motifs in transcripts. The chickpea transcripts set generated here provides a resource for gene discovery and development of functional molecular markers. In addition, the strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome data presented here will be helpful in other similar transcriptome studies.},

	abstract = {Nitrate distribution in soils is often heterogeneous. Plants have adapted to this by modifying their root system architecture ({RSA}). Previous studies showed that {NITRATE}-{TRANSPORTER}1.1 ({NRT}1.1), which also transports auxin, helps inhibit lateral root primordia ({LRP}) emergence in nitrate-poor patches, by preferentially transporting auxin away from the {LRP}. In this study, we identified the regulatory system for this response involving the transcription factor ({TF}), {SENSITIVE}-{TO}-{PROTON}-{RHIZOTOXICITY}1 ({STOP}1), which is accumulated in the nuclei of {LRP} cells under nitrate deficiency and directly regulates Arabidopsis {NRT}1.1 expression. Mutations in {STOP}1 mimic the root phenotype of the loss-of-function {NRT}1.1 mutant under nitrate deficiency, compared to wild-type plants, including increased {LR} growth and higher {DR}5promoter activity (i.e., higher {LRP} auxin signaling/activity). Nitrate deficiency?induced {LR} growth inhibition was almost completely reversed when {STOP}1 and the {TF}, {TEOSINTE}-{BRANCHED}1,-{CYCLOIDEA},-{PCF}-{DOMAIN}-{FAMILY}-{PROTEIN}20 ({TCP}20), a known activator of {NRT}1.1 expression, were both mutated. Thus, the {STOP}1-{TCP}20 system is required for activation of {NRT}1.1 expression under nitrate deficiency, leading to reduced {LR} growth in nitrate-poor regions. We found this {STOP}1-mediated system is more active as growth media becomes more acidic, which correlates with reductions in soil nitrate as the soil {pH} becomes more acidic. {STOP}1 has been shown to be involved in {RSA} modifications in response to phosphate deficiency and increased potassium uptake, hence, our findings indicate that root growth regulation in response to low availability of the major fertilizer nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, all involve {STOP}1, which may allow plants to maintain appropriate root growth under the complex and varying soil distribution of nutrients.},

	abstract = {Current approaches in chemical hazard assessment face significant challenges because they rely on live animal testing, which is time-consuming, expensive, and ethically questionable. These concerns serve as an impetus to develop new approach methodologies ({NAMs}) that do not rely on live animal tests. This study explored a molecular benchmark dose ({BMD}) approach using a 7-day embryo-larval fathead minnow ({FHM}) assay to derive transcriptomic points-of-departure ({tPODs}) to predict apical {BMDs} of fluoxetine ({FLX}), a highly prescribed and potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor frequently detected in surface waters. Fertilized {FHM} embryos were exposed to graded concentrations of {FLX} (confirmed at {\textless} {LOD}, 0.19, 0.74, 3.38, 10.2, 47.5 μg/L) for 32 days. Subsets of fish were subjected to omics and locomotor analyses at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) and to histological and biometric measurements at 32 dpf. Enrichment analyses of transcriptomics and proteomics data revealed significant perturbations in gene sets associated with serotonergic and axonal functions. {BMD} analysis resulted in {tPOD} values of 0.56 μg/L (median of the 20 most sensitive gene-level {BMDs}), 5.0 μg/L (tenth percentile of all gene-level {BMDs}), 7.51 μg/L (mode of the first peak of all gene-level {BMDs}), and 5.66 μg/L (pathway-level {BMD}). These {tPODs} were protective of locomotor and reduced body weight effects ({LOEC} of 10.2 μg/L) observed in this study and were reflective of chronic apical {BMDs} of {FLX} reported in the literature. Furthermore, the distribution of gene-level {BMDs} followed a bimodal pattern, revealing disruption of sensitive neurotoxic pathways at low concentrations and metabolic pathway perturbations at higher concentrations. This is one of the first studies to derive protective {tPODs} for {FLX} using a short-term embryo assay at a life stage not considered to be a live animal under current legislations.},

	abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in {DNA} sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on {cDNA} and expressed sequence tag ({EST}) mapping to genomic {DNA} or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant {cDNA} and {EST} data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic {DNA}. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

	abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies and increased access to sequencing have led to recent renewed interest in sequence assembly algorithms and tools.Assembly continues to be a computationally challenging problem in which engineering 'details' play a more important part than the choice of a specific assembly paradigm in defining the performance and accuracy of assemblers.Modern sequence assemblers continue to explore new ways to capture and to analyse graph structures to carry out assembly in a time- and memory-efficient manner.Most assembly programs are based on heuristics and ad hoc techniques and provide no guarantees on the correctness of the reconstructed sequence. Recent tools have sought to address this need by focusing on assembly tasks in which exact algorithms are feasible.The availability of multiple sequencing technologies and library preparation protocols has brought into focus the importance of experimental design in sequence assembly.Coupling of experimental design with the development of assembly algorithms may be key to optimizing assembly results in the future.A combination of in silico assessment and validation using independent experimental data is currently used to assess the reliability of sequence assembly, although computational tools for assembly validation are still limited in number.Sequence assembly is increasingly used for applications other than the traditional role of assembling genomes, including transcriptome analysis, reconstruction of microbial communities (metagenomics) and the discovery of genomic variants.Application-specific assemblers, which exploit characteristics of the sequences to be reconstructed, have emerged as an important area of focus for assembly research.},

	abstract = {Trichoderma is a cosmopolitan and opportunistic ascomycete fungal genus including species that are of interest to agriculture as direct biological control agents of phytopathogens. Trichoderma utilizes direct antagonism and competition, particularly in the rhizosphere, where it modulates the composition of and interactions with other microorganisms. In its colonization of plants, on the roots or as an endophyte, Trichoderma has evolved the capacity to communicate with the plant and produce numerous multifaceted benefits to its host. The intricacy of this plant–microorganism association has stimulated a marked interest in research on Trichoderma, ranging from its capacity as a plant growth promoter to its ability to prime local and systemic defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses and to activate transcriptional memory affecting plant responses to future stresses. This Review discusses the ecophysiology and diversity of Trichoderma and the complexity of its relationships in the agroecosystem, highlighting its potential as a direct and indirect biological control agent, biostimulant and biofertilizer, which are useful multipurpose properties for agricultural applications. We also highlight how the present legislative framework might accommodate the demonstrated evidence of Trichoderma proficiency as a plant-beneficial microorganism contributing towards eco-sustainable agriculture.},

By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.{NGS} technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical {DNA} sequencing, real-time pathogen {DNA} monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of {NGS} in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for {NGS} in the future.

However, studies on how genome structure and nuclear organisation influence transcription have so far been limited to a handful of model species. This narrow focus limits our ability to draw general conclusions about the ways in which three-dimensional structures are encoded, and to integrate information from three-dimensional data to address a broader gamut of biological questions. Here, we generate a complete and gapless genome sequence for the filamentous fungus, Epichloë festucae. We use Hi-C data to examine the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and {RNA}-seq data to investigate how Epichloë genome structure contributes to the suite of transcriptional changes needed to maintain symbiotic relationships with the grass host. Our results reveal a genome in which very repeat-rich blocks of {DNA} with discrete boundaries are interspersed by gene-rich sequences that are almost repeat-free. In contrast to other species reported to date, the three-dimensional structure of the genome is anchored by these repeat blocks, which act to isolate transcription in neighbouring gene-rich regions. Genes that are differentially expressed in planta are enriched near the boundaries of these repeat-rich blocks, suggesting that their three-dimensional orientation partly encodes and regulates the symbiotic relationship formed by this organism.},

It has become evident that centromeres can be established

protein components, and epigenetic marks remains uncertain.
However, some evolutionary preferences seem to exist, and
long-term established centromeres are frequently formed on long

progress in understanding functional centromere sequences is
based largely on the high-resolution {DNA} mapping of sequences
that interact with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant,
the most reliable marker of active centromeres. In addition,
sequence assembly and mapping of large repetitive centromeric
regions, as well as comparative genome analyses offer insight
into their complex organization and evolution. The rapidly
advancing field of transcription in centromere regions
highlights the functional importance of centromeric transcripts.
Here, we comprehensively review the current state of knowledge

active centromeres and discuss their contribution to the
functioning of different centromere types in higher eukaryotes.},

Recently, the study of the nuclear genomes of Trichoderma has expanded in the directions of adaptation and evolution to gain a better understanding of their ecological traits. However, Trichoderma's mitochondria have received much less attention despite mitochondria being the most necessary element for sustaining cell life. In this study, a mitogenome of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum {CBS} 226.95 was assembled de novo. A 27,632 bp circular {DNA} molecule was revealed with specific features, such as the intronless of all core {PCGs}, one homing endonuclease, and a putative overlapping {tRNA}, on a closer phylogenetic relationship with T. reesei among hypocrealean fungi. Interestingly, the mitogenome of T. harzianum {CBS} 226.95 was predicted to have evolved earlier than those of other Trichoderma species and also assumed with a selection pressure in the cox3. Considering the bioavailability, both for the ex-neotype strain of the T. harzianum species complex and the most globally representative commercial fungal biocontrol agent, our results on the T. harzianum {CBS} 226.95 mitogenome provide crucial information which will be helpful criteria in future studies on Trichoderma.},

	abstract = {Abstract Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from {OrthoDB}, {BUSCO} can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the {BUSCO} tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. {BUSCO} is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various {BUSCO} running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the {BUSCO} setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and {BUSCO} “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using {BUSCO} results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Trichoderma spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites ({SMs}). The recent publication of the genome sequences of three Trichoderma spp. has revealed a vast repertoire of genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of {SMs}, such as non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenoids and pyrones. Interestingly, the genomes of the mycoparasitic species Trichoderma virens and Trichoderma atroviride are enriched in secondary metabolism-related genes compared with the biomass-degrading Trichoderma reesei: 18 and 18 polyketide synthases compared with 11; 28 and 16 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases compared with 10, respectively. All three species produce a special class of non-ribosomally synthesized peptides known as peptaibols, containing non-proteinogenic amino acids (particularly α-aminoisobutyric acid). In common with other filamentous ascomycetes, Trichoderma spp. may require siderophores (also produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases) to grow in iron-poor conditions and to compete with their hosts for available iron. Two generalizations can be made about fungal {SM} genes: they are often found in clusters, and many are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. This has made it difficult to identify the compounds. Trichoderma, in particular, interacts with other microbes in the soil and with plant roots in the rhizosphere. A detailed metabolomic–genomic study would eventually unravel the roles of many of these {SMs} in natural ecosystems. Novel genetic tools developed recently, combined with biological understanding of the function of {SMs} as toxins or signals, should lead to ‘awakening’ of these ‘silent’ clusters. Knowledge of the {SM} repertoire should precede application of Trichoderma strains for biocontrol: some metabolites could be toxic to plants and their consumers, and thus should be avoided. Others could be beneficial, antagonizing pathogens or inducing resistance in crop plants.},

The advent of genomic technologies has revolutionized the study of fungal ecology and evolution. Surprisingly, evolutionary genomic investigations have revealed that horizontal gene transfer ({HGT})—the movement of genetic material from one organism to another by means other than sexual reproduction—is an important factor influencing the ecology and evolution of fungal genomes. This chapter uses an evolutionary framework to discuss the extent and distribution of {HGT} across fungal ecologies and lifestyles, focusing on some of the best-supported cases to address fundamental questions such as frequencies, barriers, and mechanisms for eukaryotic {HGT}. One important conclusion that can be drawn from studies of fungal {HGT} is that {HGT} rate varies extensively across lineages and that this variation can generally be associated with distinctive ecologies, lifestyles, or genetic backgrounds. Similarly, not all functional categories of genes are equally likely to result in successful transfers. The factors underlying both frequency and functional variations of {HGT} across fungi are thoroughly discussed. Advances in genomic and synthetic biology technologies will continue to shed light on these questions and bring many other still unanswered questions into focus. Some of these questions and directions for future research are highlighted at the end of this chapter.},

Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, {BRAKER}2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. {MAKER}2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of {BRAKER}2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species.

	abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in {DNA} sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on {cDNA} and expressed sequence tag ({EST}) mapping to genomic {DNA} or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant {cDNA} and {EST} data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic {DNA}. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

Recent tools have sought to address this need by focusing on assembly tasks in which exact algorithms are feasible.The availability of multiple sequencing technologies and library preparation protocols has brought into focus the importance of experimental design in sequence assembly.Coupling of experimental design with the development of assembly algorithms may be key to optimizing assembly results in the future.A combination of in silico assessment and validation using independent experimental data is currently used to assess the reliability of sequence assembly, although computational tools for assembly validation are still limited in number.Sequence assembly is increasingly used for applications other than the traditional role of assembling genomes, including transcriptome analysis, reconstruction of microbial communities (metagenomics) and the discovery of genomic variants.Application-specific assemblers, which exploit characteristics of the sequences to be reconstructed, have emerged as an important area of focus for assembly research.},

Trichoderma utilizes direct antagonism and competition, particularly in the rhizosphere, where it modulates the composition of and interactions with other microorganisms. In its colonization of plants, on the roots or as an endophyte, Trichoderma has evolved the capacity to communicate with the plant and produce numerous multifaceted benefits to its host. The intricacy of this plant–microorganism association has stimulated a marked interest in research on Trichoderma, ranging from its capacity as a plant growth promoter to its ability to prime local and systemic defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses and to activate transcriptional memory affecting plant responses to future stresses. This Review discusses the ecophysiology and diversity of Trichoderma and the complexity of its relationships in the agroecosystem, highlighting its potential as a direct and indirect biological control agent, biostimulant and biofertilizer, which are useful multipurpose properties for agricultural applications.

However, studies on how genome structure and nuclear organisation influence transcription have so far been limited to a handful of model species. This narrow focus limits our ability to draw general conclusions about the ways in which three-dimensional structures are encoded, and to integrate information from three-dimensional data to address a broader gamut of biological questions. Here, we generate a complete and gapless genome sequence for the filamentous fungus, Epichloë festucae. We use Hi-C data to examine the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and {RNA}-seq data to investigate how Epichloë genome structure contributes to the suite of transcriptional changes needed to maintain symbiotic relationships with the grass host. Our results reveal a genome in which very repeat-rich blocks of {DNA} with discrete boundaries are interspersed by gene-rich sequences that are almost repeat-free. In contrast to other species reported to date, the three-dimensional structure of the genome is anchored by these repeat blocks, which act to isolate transcription in neighbouring gene-rich regions. Genes that are differentially expressed in planta are enriched near the boundaries of these repeat-rich blocks, suggesting that their three-dimensional orientation partly encodes and regulates the symbiotic relationship formed by this organism.},

In this study, a mitogenome of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum {CBS} 226.95 was assembled de novo.

A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present {QUAST}-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. {QUAST} can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. {QUAST} produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used {QUAST} to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. {QUAST} tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the {QUAST} website. {AVAILABILITY}: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast . {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Abstract Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from {OrthoDB}, {BUSCO} can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the {BUSCO} tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. {BUSCO} is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various {BUSCO} running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the {BUSCO} setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and {BUSCO} “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using {BUSCO} results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Secondary metabolites are a reliable and very important source of medicinal compounds. While these molecules have been mined extensively, genome sequencing has suggested that there is a great deal of chemical diversity and bioactivity that remains to be discovered and characterized. A central challenge to the field is that many of the novel or poorly understood molecules are expressed at low levels in the laboratory—such molecules are often described as the ‘cryptic’ secondary metabolites. In this review, we will discuss evidence that research in this field has provided us with sufficient knowledge and tools to express and purify any secondary metabolite of interest. We will describe ‘unselective’ strategies that bring about global changes in secondary metabolite output as well as ‘selective’ strategies where a specific biosynthetic gene cluster of interest is manipulated to enhance the yield of a single product.},

	abstract = {Trichoderma spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites ({SMs}). The recent publication of the genome sequences of three Trichoderma spp. has revealed a vast repertoire of genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of {SMs}, such as non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenoids and pyrones. Interestingly, the genomes of the mycoparasitic species Trichoderma virens and Trichoderma atroviride are enriched in secondary metabolism-related genes compared with the biomass-degrading Trichoderma reesei: 18 and 18 polyketide synthases compared with 11; 28 and 16 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases compared with 10, respectively. All three species produce a special class of non-ribosomally synthesized peptides known as peptaibols, containing non-proteinogenic amino acids (particularly α-aminoisobutyric acid). In common with other filamentous ascomycetes, Trichoderma spp. may require siderophores (also produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases) to grow in iron-poor conditions and to compete with their hosts for available iron. Two generalizations can be made about fungal {SM} genes: they are often found in clusters, and many are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. This has made it difficult to identify the compounds. Trichoderma, in particular, interacts with other microbes in the soil and with plant roots in the rhizosphere. A detailed metabolomic–genomic study would eventually unravel the roles of many of these {SMs} in natural ecosystems. Novel genetic tools developed recently, combined with biological understanding of the function of {SMs} as toxins or signals, should lead to ‘awakening’ of these ‘silent’ clusters. Knowledge of the {SM} repertoire should precede application of Trichoderma strains for biocontrol: some metabolites could be toxic to plants and their consumers, and thus should be avoided. Others could be beneficial, antagonizing pathogens or inducing resistance in crop plants.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Although many next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. Results: The value of {NGS} read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. Availability and implementation: Trimmomatic is licensed under {GPL} V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic Contact: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
