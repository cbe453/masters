abstract = {Early efforts at sequencing the genomes of bacteria, viruses, and yeast allowed scientists to test and troubleshoot methods of automated sequencing, chromosome assembly, and gene annotation. Using these methods, researchers were able to sequence several unicellular genomes by the year 2000. However, many interesting biological questions remained, and a great deal of these questions related to issues involving development, disease, and complex traits that are found only in multicellular organisms. For example, how are limbs and tissues encoded in the genome? How is the brain made? What are the genetic contributions to behavior? Today, researchers are deeply involved in the shotgun sequencing of various complex genomes in an attempt to answer such questions. Interestingly, they have found that neither genome size nor number of genes determines the complexity of multicellular organisms.},
