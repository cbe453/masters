  abstract  = "The centromere is a chromosomal locus responsible for the
               faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division.
               It has become evident that centromeres can be established
               literally on any DNA sequence, and the possible synergy between
               DNA sequences and the most prominent centromere identifiers,
               protein components, and epigenetic marks remains uncertain.
               However, some evolutionary preferences seem to exist, and
               long-term established centromeres are frequently formed on long
               arrays of satellite DNAs and/or transposable elements. Recent
               progress in understanding functional centromere sequences is
               based largely on the high-resolution DNA mapping of sequences
               that interact with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant,
               the most reliable marker of active centromeres. In addition,
               sequence assembly and mapping of large repetitive centromeric
               regions, as well as comparative genome analyses offer insight
               into their complex organization and evolution. The rapidly
               advancing field of transcription in centromere regions
               highlights the functional importance of centromeric transcripts.
               Here, we comprehensively review the current state of knowledge
               on the composition and functionality of DNA sequences underlying
               active centromeres and discuss their contribution to the
               functioning of different centromere types in higher eukaryotes.",
