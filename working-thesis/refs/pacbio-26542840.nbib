AB  - Single-molecule, real-time sequencing developed by Pacific BioSciences offers 
      longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, 
      making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and 
      epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio 
      sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize 
      structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence 
      through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are 
      associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is 
      advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable 
      discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its 
      ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant 
      lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is 
      useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In 
      addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have 
      been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with 
      PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable 
      and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing 
      alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that 
      could not be obtained via SGS alone.
