\section{Pre-work}

\subsection{Existing selection of Genome Assemblies}

Comparison of several different \textit{Trichoderma} genomes is
important in the context of gene finding tools as different gene
finding tools will find different genes and understanding how these
tools behave in the context of different \textit{Trichoderma} genomes
could prove useful for those looking to find genes in similar fungal
genomes in the future. To accent the processing for genomes of
interest, those being DC1 and Tsht20, we should include other
previously assembled \textit{Trichoderma} assemblies. Currently
selected genomes include \textit{Trichoderma reesei},
\textit{Trichoderma harzianum}, and \textit{Trichoderma virens?}, with
\textit{Trichoderma reesei} being the 'reference' in this case, as it
is well studied and there are several patents involving it's use a
organsim for production of compounds such as antibiotics in industrial
applications.

\subsection{Assembly}

The foundation of this project is base ond the sequencing of two novel
\textit{Trichoderma} strains identified in prairie regions of Canada
(Alberta and Saskatchewan). To assemble these genomes, a hybrid
assembly process was used, following default assembly parameters with
MASuRcA, which utilizes the Flye assembler if both Nanopore and
Illumina data are used as inputs, which are the inputs in this
case. The next paragraph describes the process of working with MASuRcA.

MASuRcA 4.0.3 was run using the Compute Canada software stack
available on Copernicus.  Prior to loading the MASuRcA environment,
the GCC/9.0 and StdEnv/2020 modules must be loaded first. This version
of the software is not ideal, but the Anaconda installation of versino
4.0.9 consistently failed, even in a fresh environment.  Building the
software from scratch is a potential option. In addition to this
difficulty, the assemblies were performed in the p2irc\_rsmi scratch
space on Copernicus as I was encountering permissions issues when
trying to run the assembly in the Roots datastore.  I don't know
exactly why (microsoft permissions problems from datastore?, but there
were permission issues associated with scripts being copied to
datastore as part of the assembly process. All assembly materials were
copied back to datastore after assembly.

Initially, a configuration file must be generated to run MASuRcA with
the optimal combination of assembly tools for the data supplied (Flye
+ polishing). Running MASuRcA from the commandline tool utilizes the
CABOG celera-based assembler, which is noted as being slower and
results in an assembly with similar or worse quality than one using
Flye.

To generate the config file, run the following:
masurca -g config.txt

The config file was then altered to provide input file, options and
allowable number of threads for assembly. All other assembly
parameters were left untouched. Insert lengths for the Illumina read
data used the recommended values (stated to work for most Illumina
reads), although these could be modified with input from Brendan. The
config files for both assemblies are available in the assebly
directories.

To generate the assembly.sh script, run:
masurca config.txt

Once the assembly.sh script is generated, execute the assembly using:
./assemble.sh

Final assemblies are placed in directories with the prefix flye.mr.*
Quast analysis of the genomes was also performed, with the output
being placed in directories named quast within the assembly directory.

To run Quast:
quast -o ./ -t 16 assembly-file.fasta

In an attempt to produce higher quality assemblies of DC1 and Tsth20,
It has been suggested that I try a set of tools call NextDenovo and
NextPolish as they have produced excellent assemblies based on
previous experience from supervisors.

Installation of NextDenovo was straightforward. Simply download the
compressed tar file from their website and unpack it. NextDenovo
requires Python versions 2 and 3 along with a package called parallel
to aid in parallel processing of datasets. I installed parallel using
pip in the bioinformatics conda environment in the scracth space of
Copernicus.

Initial attempts to run the example dataset resulted in some
permissions errors, which I have encountered with other tools in the
past. Thank you datastore. To remedy this, I copied the installation
to RSMI's scratch space on Copernicus. Once the approriate permissions
were given to run nextDenovo, I was able to run the example dataset
assembly without issue. Future assemblies of DC1 and Tsth20 will be
performed in this scratch space to avoid permissiions issues and
results will be copied to datastore.

\subsection{Repeat Masking}

In order to evaluate the performance of gene finding tools in
repetitive or low complexity regions in the context of
\textit{Trichoderma} genomes, we must first identify said regions in
the genomes considered. To do this, RepeaatMasker has been selected as
a tool to identify repeat regions based on a fungal subset of the Dfam
database by specifying the fungo species tag to RepeatMasker when
running the program. The program was configured with options to
produce several output formats for each genome considered, which will
allow for more informative downstream analysis of results. All
commands for repeat masking are located withing the processing
directory for each strain/genome.

The Installation procedure was somewhat indepth, requiring
RepeatMasker configuration, which itself requires downloading an
appropriate repeat database (Dfam in this case, included with
RepeatMasker), installation of Tandem Repeat Finder (TRFM) and
installation of a sequence search tool, for which I chose HMMER from
the list of potential tools as I am generally familiar with its use.

General command for running RepeatMasker:
/datastore/Roots/Connor/masters/software/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker/RepeatMasker
-pa 10 -a -small -species fungi -html -gff -dir ./
path-to-genome/genome.fasta


\section{Software Installation}

Currently, GeneMark-ES and Braker2 have been difficult to install and
have not been successfully installed yet.

GenomeThreader installed successfully via Anaconda in the
bioinformatics environments on cnic-gifs-aio-18001 (rsmi01).

\section{Gene Finding}

Now that we have covered information about assembling and installation
of these tools, we can cover the gene finding portion of this work.

To begin, I ran GeneMark-ES as it requires no prior information or
alignments in order to run. In this case GeneMark-ES has an option
specifically for fungal genomes, which I chose to use in this case.
