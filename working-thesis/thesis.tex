\title{Comparative analysis of Gene Finding tools when applied to
  \textit{Trichoderma} genomes} 
  \author{Connor Burbridge}

\parindent=14pt

\abstract{
This thesis presents a comparative analysis of gene prediction tools applied to genomes of the genus \textit{Trichoderma}. The study evaluates the performance of several widely used gene finding algorithms, assessing their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using both computational benchmarks and biological validation. Genomic datasets from multiple \textit{Trichoderma} species were analyzed, and the predicted gene models were compared against reference annotations and experimental data. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of each tool, providing recommendations for optimal gene annotation strategies in fungal genomics. This work contributes to improved annotation pipelines and a deeper understanding of gene structure in \textit{Trichoderma}, facilitating future research in genetics, biotechnology, and agriculture.

The comparative analysis conducted in this thesis demonstrates that gene prediction tools exhibit varying levels of performance across different \textit{Trichoderma} species. Gene finders generally showed high sensitivity in detecting conserved genes, and predicted gene models contained functional domains, as validated by InterProScan. However, discrepancies were observed in start and stop positions, exon-intron structures, and alternative splicing events among the tools. Notably, gene prediction accuracy declined in AT-rich genomic regions, where fewer genes were identified compared to regions with normal GC content. Overall, the study provides practical recommendations for selecting and combining gene finding tools to improve fungal genome annotation, supporting future research in genetics and biotechnology.

In addition to the main findings, the genomes of two novel \textit{Trichoderma} species, DC1 and Tsth20, were successfully assembled and annotated, resulting in high-quality genomic resources. The assemblies exhibited near-chromosomal scale contigs and performed well in standard assembly metrics. The gene predictions generated by the evaluated tools produced a rich dataset of annotations for these genomes, which can be leveraged for further biological investigations. Both assemblies are pending submission to NCBI's GenBank database, where they will be made publicly available to the research community.
