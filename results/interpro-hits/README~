BCBio GFF package is not happy with the way that InterProScan formats
its GFF files. IPS includes fasta entries of the hits at the end of
the GFF entries, which throws an error. In addition to that, IPS
description field in the GFF file may contain extra '=' symbols,
resulting in an error (EC=2 -> EC-2). I used sed to fix both of these
issues and produce a new GFF file in this processing directory.

sed -n '/\#\#FASTA/q;p' /Volumes/Roots/Connor/masters/processing/dc1/interproscan/genemark/dc1-genemark.aa.gff3 | sed 's/EC=/EC-/' > dc1-genemark-ips-fmt.gff3
