\section{Background}

\subsection{Trichoderma}

Crop resistance to environmental stressors is a necessity for crop
health and overall crop yields. Current popular methods for crop
protection involve the use of pesticides and genetically modified
organisms, which can be expensive and potentially politically dividing
in the case of GMOs (citation needed). In addition, crops will suffer
when soils are not sufficient for crop growth and health. Soil
insufficiencies can result in drought stress as well as nutrient
stress, leading to poor overall yields.

\textit{Trichoderma} is a type of fungi that can colonize the roots of
plants in a non-toxic, non-lethal, opportunistic symbiotic
relationship\cite{Trichoderma}. Many strains of \textit{Trichoderma}
have been shown to provide resistance to bacteria and other fungi in
soils through the use of polyketides, non-ribosomal peptide
synthetases and other antibiotic
products\cite{Trichoderma}\cite{Secretome}. Recently, two strains of
\textit{Trichoderma} have been identified in the prairie regions of
Alberta and Saskatchewan. These two strains, named Tsth20 and DC1,
have been found to have beneficial properties when used as an
inoculant for plants in the soils mentioned before. In addition to
these beneficial properties, the two strains mentioned previously
provide even further protection for plants in dry, salty soils and one
strain also has potential for use as a bioremediation tool in soils
contaminated with hydrocarbon content. However, little is known about
the mechanisms at work in these new strains, so DC1 and Tsth20 were
sequenced by the Global Institute for Food Security (no publication
yet so no reference?) in an initial attempt to better understand the
details of these genomes and secretomes.

\subsection{Genome Assembly}

Sequence assembly has been a long-standing application problem in the
field of bioinformatics\cite{assembly}. Determining the correct order
and combination of smaller subsequences into an accurate sequence
assembly is also computationally difficult in terms of compute
resources such as memory, CPU cycles and storage required for input
sequences\cite{assembly}. In addition to these difficulties, there can
be other issues encountered during asssembly due to the nature of
the data or genomes themselves, such as low quality base calls for
long read data or the inherent content of genomes themselves with
repetitive regions as an example. Insufficient data used in an
assembly may result in short, fragmented assemblies, depending on the
size of the genomes, while sequence data that is not long enough can
fail to fully capture repetitive regions in an assembly. To solve this
problem, a wide range of assembly tools have been developed with their
own unique approaches to genome assembly problems, so it is important
to use an appropriate assembler for the task at hand, and important to
evaluate the assembly thoroughly. One approach to aid in the
previously mentioned issue of assembly correctness, is to use a
combination of long and short reads in what is known as a hybrid
assembly. Combining both highly accurate short reads with deep
coverage along with less accurate but much longer reads can produce
high quality genome assemblies that capture long repetitive
regions. Assemblies must also be evaluated with measures such as N50,
L50, coverage, average contig length and total assembled length to
ensure that the genomes are well assembled, at least based on these
metrics\cite{assembly}. Following appropriate assembly protocols is
essential to the further success of a project as downstream processing
such as annotation depends on a high-quality assembly.

\subsection{Repeat Identification/Masking and Identification of AT-rich Genomic regions}
Repeat identification within assembled genomes is a problem that
needs to be considered during the genome annotation process. Regions
with long repeats can have a significant impact on genome assembly as
well as gene finding due to the limitation of short reads used in some
assemblies\cite{Repeats}. Short reads may be unable to bridge or cover
entire repeat regions within a genome, so it is important to consider
the use of long reads such as Nanopore or PacBio to provide a complete
picture of these regions when pursuing a new genome assembly
project. It is also possible for these repetitive regions to contain
genes as well, making for an interesting investigation in regards to
\textit{Trichoderma}, as fungal genomes have been shown to contain
many repeat regions with a high concentration of A and T
nucleotides\cite{fungalrepeats}. Once these repetitive regions have
been identified (by any number of existing programs), the genome could
be masked to exlude these regions in downstream processing if desired,
as these regions may be poorly assembled and may result in found genes
that may not truly exist in those regions. However, this may not be as
common today\cite{dontMask}. This may affect the gene finding process
described later and may be an interesting topic to look into
considering the large number of available gene finding programs
available.

\subsection{Gene Finding}
Gene finding is another long standing computational problem in
bioinformatics, which concerns itself with identifying potential genes
within genomes based on patterns or evidence considered by the gene
finding program. There are two common methods for gene finding, those
methods being \textit{ab initio} methods where programs search for
patterns and gene structures, while similarity or evidence-based
searches use prior information such as RNAseq data, expressed sequence
tags and protein sequences to identify genes within a new
genome\cite{GeneFinding}. Complicating the process more is the
introduction of introns and alternative splicing in eukaryotes, making
it possible for one gene to have several possible transcripts at the
same locus. Examples of \textit{ab initio} methods include tools such
as GeneMark-ES\cite{GeneMarkES} and AUGUSTUS\cite{AUGUSTUS}, while
evidence based methods include tools such as Braker2\cite{Braker2},
which can incorporate existing data such as RNAseq, protein sequences, 
etc. in gene prediction models.

As mentioned in the repeat finding section of this proposal, long
repeats and transposable elements can cause issues for gene finding
programs, making this an interesting area of research, at least for
fungal genomes such as \textit{Trichoderma}. Fungal genomes are also
interesting in the topic of gene finding as there are few programs
targeted directly at gene finding in fungal genomes while organisms
such as human, mouse, and \textit{Arabidopsis} benefit from having
many tools tested on them as they are model organisms in the field, at
least according to table 1 in (Wang, Z \textit{et
  al})\cite{GeneFinding}. How these different methods and tools
perform when applied to fungal genomes is an important consideration
as fungi have features that can benefit plant growth as mentioned
earlier.


\section{Research problem}
Genome annotation, in the case of gene finding in this work, has been
a popular computational problem for decades. The identification of
possible genes provides other researchers with a valuable resource for
future research avenues. Due to the importance and popularity of this
topic, there have been a variety of gene finding tools developed, each
with their own implementation for certain applications or use
cases. The abundance of gene finding tools raises questions such as
which tool is better? Do different tools provide drastically different
results? Are there differences in the number and/or of accuracy
predicted genes in repetitive genomic regions between \textit{ab
  initio} methods and similarity-based methods?  Comparative studies
of gene finding tools have been performed before, however most of
these studies are in reference to popular eukaryotic subjects of study
such as humans, mice and \textit{Arabidopsis}. Few if any comparative
studies have been performed in fungal genomes, and even fewer in the
case of \textit{Trichoderma}.

This lack of comparative analysis in fungal genomes provides a
research avenue to compare results from the application of different
gene finding tools to new and existing \textit{Trichoderma}
assemblies. Results from using different annotation tools will allow
us to identify a core genome along with genes that are not predicted
by all tools in all genomes, or outliers. This analysis will also
allow us to compare results from both evidence-based gene finding
methods as well as \textit{ab-initio} gene finding methods. One
interesting area to investigate between these methods would be in
regions of low nuclotide diversity, or the AT-rich regions common to
\textit{Trichoderma} and other fungi. It is possible that gene finding
programs may have difficulty with these regions of genomes, as they
may contain repeat regions and as mentioned before, have low
nucleotide diversity, making it unlikely but not impossible for genes
to be found in these regions. Results from this work will provide
insight into the use of different gene finding tools in the context of
\textit{Trichoderma}. This work will also provide a large set of
called genes spanning at minimum two newly assembled
\textit{Trichoderma} genomes, those being DC1 and Tsth20, as well as
other previously assembled \textit{Trichoderma} genomes from NCBI or
other sources.
